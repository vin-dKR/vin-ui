>🚀 VIN-UI CLI: Your Rust-Powered Sidekick for Next.js Greatness 😎

Welcome to the **VIN-UI CLI**, the Rust-fueled beast that lets you slap gorgeous UI components into your Next.js projects faster than you can say "npm install" (yuck!). 🐢💤 This guide is your cheat sheet to wielding VIN-UI like a pro, with zero package manager nonsense. Ready to make your app look so good it’ll have users throwing their credit cards at you? 💸 Let’s dive in! 😏

# What the fug is it? 🤔

VIN-UI is a CLI tool that runs on Rust’s lightning speed 🦀, letting you initialize a component directory, list available components, and add them to your Next.js project with simple copy-paste vibes. No npm, no Bun, just pure, chad-level efficiency. 💪 Built by Vinod KR, this bad boy is here to make your UI game unstoppable. 🔥

# Before You Start 📋

Make sure you’ve got VIN-UI installed. If not, check out our [installation guide](install.mdx) to clone the repo and get it running. You’ll also need:

- A **Next.js project** ready to be jazzed up. Don’t have one? Run `npx create-next-app@latest` to whip one up. 🚀
- A terminal and some swagger. 😎

Got that? Let’s get to the fun part! 🎉

# CLI Commands 🪄

The VIN-UI CLI is loaded with four main commands to make your life easy. Here’s how to use them, with examples to keep things chill.

## 1. Initialize Your Project (`init`) 🏗️

Before you start dropping components, you need to set up your Next.js project to play nice with VIN-UI. The `init` command creates the right folder structure so you’re ready to roll.

```bash
cd your-nextjs-project
vin-ui init
```

**What it does**:
- Creates a `components/ui/` folder where your shiny components will live.
- Adds a `lib/utils.ts` file for any utility functions your components might need.

**When to use it**: Run this once in your Next.js project directory to get started. Think of it as laying the foundation for your UI empire. 🏰

## 2. List Available Components (`list`) 📜

Curious about what components VIN-UI has in its arsenal? The `list` command spills the tea on all available components you can add.

```bash
vin-ui list
```

**What it does**:
- Shows a list of components (like `Button`, `Card`, etc.) from the `templates` directory, along with any dependencies or utilities they need.

**When to use it**: Run this when you’re browsing for inspiration or planning your UI. It’s like window-shopping for components, but free! 🛍️

## 3. Add a Component (`add`) 🛠️

This is where the magic happens. The `add` command lets you grab a component and drop it into your project, ready to use.

```bash
vin-ui add Button
```

**What it does**:
- Copies the `Button` component (or whatever you choose) into your `components/ui/` folder.
- Sets up any required dependencies or utilities automatically.

**When to use it**: Whenever you want to add a specific component to your project. Run `vin-ui list` first to see what’s available. Pro tip: You can chain these to add multiple components like a boss. 😏

**Example**:
```bash
vin-ui add Card
vin-ui add Navbar
```
Now your project has a `Card` and `Navbar` component, ready to make your app look fire. 🔥

## 4. Get Help (`help` or `--help`) ❓

Lost? Need a refresher? The `help` command (or `-h`/`--help` flag) is your trusty sidekick, spitting out a cool ASCII logo and all the CLI details.

```bash
vin-ui help
# or
vin-ui --help
# or
vin-ui -h
```

**What it does**:
- Prints a snazzy blue ASCII logo (because why not?) and a breakdown of all commands, flags, and examples.
- Looks something like this:

# Example Workflow 😎

Here’s how you might use VIN-UI to level up your Next.js project in a few minutes:

1. **Set up your project**:
   ```bash
   cd my-awesome-app
   vin-ui init
   ```

2. **Check out the goods**:
   ```bash
   vin-ui list
   ```

3. **Add some components**:
   ```bash
   vin-ui add Button
   vin-ui add Hero
   ```

4. **Use them in your app**:
   ```jsx
   import { Button, Hero } from '@/components/ui';

   export default function Home() {
     return (
       <div>
         <Hero title="Welcome to My App" cta="Get Started" />
         <Button>Click Me!</Button>
       </div>
     );
   }
   ```

5. **Flex your new UI**: Run `npm run dev` and watch your app shine. ✨

# Troubleshooting 😬

- **Command not found?** Make sure `~/.cargo/bin` is in your PATH. Run `source $HOME/.cargo/env` or restart your terminal.
- **Component not adding?** Check that you ran `vin-ui init` first and that the component name matches what’s in `vin-ui list`.
- **Still confused?** Run `vin-ui help` for a refresher or hit up our GitHub issues page. We got you! 🤝
